Custom wordpress theme

A custom Wordpress theme that offers two vibrant color schemes, the reader's ability to change the font, the possibility to comment under posts or respond to comments. Custom widgets also add to the theme: the sidebar displays the most recent comments and posts and the users can interact with the comments by liking/disliking them.
